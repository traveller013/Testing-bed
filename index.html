        <p>The main contributor to the Edsinger Gallery, the titular Daryian Edsinger was
            born in Orgeon. Growing up she dreamed of stealing this car and in the summer of 2016
            she gathered a crew and pulled of the crime of the year. Posing as a visiting 
            photographer she infiltrated the museum and distraced the curator. Meanwhile 
            the Hackman spliced into the security cameras and caused a fatal error. Later,
            the Wrench Monkey and the Actor pose as contractors sent to replace the cameras.
            By, 0236 the crew drove off with the classic car of her dreams.
        </p>
        <p>Dariyan Edsinger now spends her time plotting the downfall of her neighbors and taking
            care of her overly energtic ferrets.

        <h2>Other Contributors</h2>
        <img src="images/constrution.png" alt="construction">
        <p>Seth Vargas shown here contributed alot. So much so that I 
            don't think we need to go into exactly what he gave to the 
            site. Nope, we are just going to accept the statement as fact.
